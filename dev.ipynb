Rick lands the vehicle on Morty\\'s demand and passes out. The bomb activates by itself and seems to be left unchecked, but ultimately it is shown that life on Earth remains intact. After having breakfast with their family, Rick takes Morty to another dimension to collect seeds of \"Mega Trees\", which Morty is forced to hide in his own rectum to get past intergalactic customs. However, Rick and Morty\\'s cover is blown and they escape while engaging in a shootout with alien insect soldiers. Ultimately, the seeds briefly cause Morty to be highly intelligent, despite the fact that he missed a semester of school because he\\'s been in adventures with Rick. This causes his parents to believe he is fine with his education, but this wastes the seeds, so Rick informs Morty that they need to go back and get more, while their aftereffects leave Morty writhing on the floor.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 2: \"Lawnmower Dog\"\\tJohn Rice\\tRyan Ridley\\tDecember 9, 2013\\tRAM-002\\t1.51[7]\\nOn Jerry\\'s demand, Rick gives Snuffles, the family dog, an intelligence-enhancing helmet. Rick and Morty, in an Inception-esque scenario, enter the dream of Morty\\'s teacher, in an attempt to make him give Morty an \"A\" in math class. They find themselves in a dangerous situation, where they are forced to repeatedly enter dreams within dreams to escape. Eventually, they are chased by a dream character named Scary Terry, a \"legally safe\" parody of Freddy Krueger. They manage to enter his dream, where they stand up for him against his bully teacher. This persuades Scary Terry to help them complete their mission. Meanwhile, at home, Snuffles builds a mechanical suit and assembles a dog army intending to take over Earth. Returning home from their adventure, Rick and Morty enter Snuffles\\' dream, where Rick causes Morty to fall into a coma. This prompts Snuffles to rethink his priorities, resulting in him taking his army to another planet.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Back in Scary Terry\\'s class, the old teacher has been replaced by Scary Glenn, a hippie drum player. Rick and Scary Terry are sitting as his students, smoking marijuana, satisfied with this change.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 3: \"Anatomy Park\"\\tJohn Rice\\tEric Acosta & Wade Randolph\\tDecember 16, 2013\\tRAM-003\\t1.30[8]\\nOn Christmas, Rick sends Morty inside the body of a homeless man to save his life (a parody of Fantastic Voyage). Inside the man\\'s body is a microscopic enclosure called Anatomy Park (a parody of Jurassic Park), which houses various deadly diseases that escape their enclosures. Morty and one of the park staff, Annie, flee from the rampaging diseases as they kill the rest of the base staff. Rick rescues them by enlarging the homeless man\\'s body to the width of the US before destroying it in an explosion. Back at the family home, Jerry\\'s parents visit, and the family attempts to bond without electronic devices. Jerry is dismayed to discover his parents have decided to try polyamory.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Rick contacts Annie and her other new associates inside his new patient\\'s body and as they talk about his \"Pirates of the Pancreas\" ride (much to Rick\\'s dislike, since he is sensitive about his ride because it\\'s his idea). Rick hangs up on them only to proceed with a rant and insults, also revealing Summer\\'s boyfriend Ethan as the new Anatomy Park host.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 4: \"M. Night Shaym-Aliens!\"\\tJeff Myers\\tTom Kauffman\\tJanuary 13, 2014\\tRAM-004\\t1.32[9]\\nAliens hold Rick and Jerry captive in a virtual reality, in an attempt to steal Rick\\'s recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter. As Rick attempts escape, he discovers that there are multiple virtual reality layers on top of each other. Jerry, on the other hand, despite numerous system glitches, remains completely oblivious, and keeps trying to sell his advertising slogan for apples. Rick finally games the aliens by giving them a fake recipe. The aliens send Rick and Jerry on their way, and their ship explodes as they prepare the concoction.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry is fired on the spot after debuting his new advertising slogan for apples in the real world. At night, a drunk Rick enters Morty\\'s room, starts showing appreciation for him, but quickly turns on him with a knife and demands to know if Morty is a simulation. Rick then apologizes before passing out.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 5: \"Meeseeks and Destroy\"\\tBryan Newton\\tRyan Ridley\\tJanuary 20, 2014\\tRAM-005\\t1.61[10]\\nAfter killing deadly enemies in an alternative dimension, Morty complains that Rick\\'s adventures are too dangerous and traumatizing. This leads them into a \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" type adventure, where Morty is in charge. He decides to steal the giant\\'s treasure and give it to the villagers. The giant dies by accident, Rick and Morty are charged with murder but are ultimately acquitted. Rick and Morty then descend from the Giants\\' beanstalk realm and stop in a fairy tale pub on the way down. There, King Jellybean attempts to rape Morty, but Morty escapes. Rick wins money playing poker and gives it to the villagers. As Rick and Morty are leaving this dimension, Rick kills King Jellybean, having figured out his attempted rape of Morty. Meanwhile, Beth, Summer and Jerry use Rick\\'s \"Meeseeks Box\" to spawn Meeseeks, blue creatures that fulfill one request and then explode. Jerry summons one Meeseeks to help him improve his golf game, and spends some time training, to no avail. The Meeseeks summons more of them to help, resulting in a increasingly larger crowd of frustrated Meeseeks. They decide to kill Jerry, but given one last chance, he ultimately demonstrates that his skills actually have improved and the Meeseeks are happy to disappear.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Two villagers find a box of incriminating photographs belonging to King Jellybean, which they burn to preserve the king\\'s legacy as a benevolent ruler.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 6: \"Rick Potion #9\"\\tStephen Sandoval\\tJustin Roiland\\tJanuary 27, 2014\\tRAM-006\\t1.75[11]\\nMorty is interested in going to the dance at his school with his classmate Jessica, so he asks Rick for a love potion. However, because Jessica has the flu, the potion becomes airborne and goes haywire, causing not only her but the whole population of Earth to fall for Morty save for blood relatives. Rick attempts to fix up an antidote, but he fails twice, ultimately causing all humans affected by the love potion to turn into mutated monsters called \"Cronenbergs\" (a reference to famous director of body horror films David Cronenberg). Meanwhile, Jerry visits Beth in her workplace because he is concerned about her fidelity, and they find Summer later. Rick and Morty then migrate to another dimension where their duplicates died soon after successfully curing all of Earth, thus allowing Rick and Morty to assume their roles.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry, Beth and Summer are happy to stay together as the only normal human family in their post-apocalyptic mutated world, glad that Rick and Morty are gone. Two Cronenberg versions of Rick and Morty come from the \"Cronenberg world\" to live there as well, because their home was inhabited by Cronenbergs all along, which were accidentally transformed into normal people.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 7: \"Raising Gazorpazorp\"\\tJeff Myers\\tEric Acosta & Wade Randolph\\tMarch 10, 2014\\tRAM-007\\t1.76[12]\\nIn a pawn shop in space, Rick buys Morty a sex robot. Soon after, the robot conceives Morty\\'s alien hybrid child whom he names Morty Jr. Rick and Summer go to the sex robot\\'s planet of origin, Gazorpazorp, to find better suited parents for Morty Jr. After discovering that the Gazorpazorpian females are the dominant gender on the planet, Rick and Summer learn that the males of this species mature in only days and are, by nature, extremely violent. The Gazorpazorpian females arrest Rick due to his open misogyny and threaten to execute both him and Summer until Summer reveals her fashionable top was made by a man, convincing them to let them go free. Meanwhile, Morty Jr.\\'s quick aging puts pressure on Morty to try and raise him. Fearing his aggressive instincts, Morty keeps Morty Jr. inside by telling him the air outside is poisonous. However, the isolation causes Morty Jr. to become rebellious. When he realizes Morty lied to him about the air, he gets into a fight with Morty until Rick arrives and prepares to kill Morty Jr. Morty steps in the way of Rick\\'s weapon, telling him he still loves Morty Jr. Morty Jr. decides to move out and live on his own while channeling his aggression into a creative art.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Morty Jr. goes to a talk show to talk about a book he wrote called \"My (horrible) Father\", which has become very successful.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 8: \"Rixty Minutes\"\\tBryan Newton\\tTom Kauffman & Justin Roiland\\tMarch 17, 2014\\tRAM-008\\t1.48[13]\\nAs the family watches The Bachelor, Rick is dissatisfied with the quality of Earth TV so he upgrades the cable to show programming from every conceivable dimension. Eventually, they see Jerry on TV as a successful actor in an alternate reality. The family, minus Rick and Morty, uses Rick\\'s goggles to see through the eyes of their duplicates in that alternative reality, where Jerry and Beth have successful lives, they never married, and Summer was never born because Beth had an abortion. Jerry, Beth and Summer have a heated discussion in which they conclude that family life is holding them back and Beth admits that Summer was an unwanted pregnancy. Summer feels unloved and plans to run away, but Morty tells her that he and Rick themselves came from an alternate dimension (as depicted in \"Rick Potion #9\") and persuades her to stay. Ultimately, Beth and Jerry discover that their alternate selves are miserable in their own ways and witness them getting back together, which convinces them that they also belong together.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The family goes on vacation into an alternate reality where hamsters live in human rectums that they saw on the interdimensional TV.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 9: \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\"\\tJohn Rice\\tMike McMahan\\tMarch 24, 2014\\tRAM-009\\t1.54[14]\\nSummer works in an antique shop which is run by the Devil, which gives away items that come with harmful curses. Rick sets up a competitor shop where he uses science to remove the curses, and the Devil is put out of business. Summer helps him to relaunch a successful dot-com company, but he betrays her and keeps the company for himself. Summer and Rick build muscle mass and publicly beat up the Devil to get revenge. Meanwhile, Jerry, helping Morty with his homework, insists that Pluto is a planet. They are abducted by Plutonians to their world, where Jerry is mistaken for a scientist. His statements about Pluto being a planet make him instantly popular, but it is later revealed to him that Pluto is shrinking due to corporate plutonium mining, and the Plutonian leadership keeps the population distracted by assuring them Pluto is still a planet. Jerry tells the Pluto citizens the truth on a public speech, causing him to be hated and deported back to Earth with Morty.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Rick and Summer merrily beat a Neo-Nazi, a bully, a member of the Westboro Baptist Church who has been holding an anti-gay sign, and an abusive dog owner.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 10: \"Close Rick-counters of the Rick Kind\"\\tStephen Sandoval\\tRyan Ridley\\tApril 7, 2014\\tRAM-010\\t1.75[15]\\nThe show\\'s original Rick is wrongfully accused of murdering twenty-seven Ricks from alternate dimensions and kidnapping their respective Mortys. The Trans-Dimensional Council of Ricks arrests him and finds him guilty, upon discovering incriminating evidence which was actually fabricated to frame him. Rick and Morty escape and are chased by a few duplicates of themselves. The Smith household is flooded with other Ricks and Jerry develops a friendship with the good-natured \"Doofus Rick\". The real culprits seem to be an \"Evil\" Rick and his Evil Morty, who have been using Mortys\\' low intelligence brainwaves as a way to conceal themselves. They capture the original Rick and Morty, but the original Morty leads a rebellion of alternate Mortys and releases the original Rick. Rick informs the Council about the real killer, thus clearing his own name. After Rick and Morty depart, the Council discovers that Evil Rick was actually under control by an unknown puppet-master, which was Evil Morty all along. Evil Morty escapes by blending into the crowd of Mortys without a Rick.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry waves at Doofus Rick from the window, prompting Rick to make fun of him.\\n\\nSeason 1, Episode 11: \"Ricksy Business\"\\tStephen Sandoval\\tRyan Ridley & Tom Kauffman\\tApril 14, 2014\\tRAM-011\\t2.13[16]\\nJerry and Beth participate in a reenactment of Titanic, but the ship unexpectedly fails to sink. Jerry spends some time alone with Lucy, a female janitor who eventually proves to be a deranged fan of the movie, forcing him to imitate scenes with her at gunpoint. She almost rapes Jerry, but Beth saves him. Meanwhile, Rick is left in charge of Morty and Summer, but they have a large party. Among the guests are teenagers, aliens, Gearhead, Squanchy, alternate Ricks and Abradolf Lincler (a DNA combination of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln). Not only do they make a mess, but the whole house is accidentally sent into another dimension, where Lincler seemingly dies (he actually survives). Ultimately, the guests are sent away and the house is returned to its place. Rick, Morty and Summer only have minutes to spare before Beth and Jerry arrive, so they use a contraption to freeze time, allowing them to repair the house. They watch Titanic and unanimously agree on how terrible it is.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Giant alien beasts repeatedly insert and remove Lincler and a teenager from the party in their bodies.\\n\\n    Season 2, Episode 1: \"A Rickle in Time\"\\tWes Archer\\tMatt Roller\\tJuly 26, 2015\\tRAM-201\\t2.12[11]\\nContinuing from \"Ricksy Business\", Rick, Morty and Summer spend six months repairing the house and screwing around with time frozen. After unfreezing it, the trio ends up in a decaying dimension. They split into separate timelines whenever they are uncertain about something. Rick becomes paranoid, thinking that his duplicates want to kill him, but eventually he calms down. A creature in charge of safeguarding time appears and gives them collars that integrate all the timelines, then attempts to arrest them because Rick stole the time-freezing crystal. Rick, Morty, and Summer show uncertainty on purpose and break the collars, splitting into sixty-four timelines, and they simultaneously beat up the same creature. Rick then repairs the collars, and they successfully integrate all the timelines. In one timeline, Rick attempts to sacrifice himself and let Morty live by giving him his collar, but ultimately he survives too. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry hit a deer, and bring it to an animal hospital. A hunter claims the deer for his own because he shot it before the accident. Beth is able to save the deer\\'s life and release it.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The creature and his friend beat up Albert Einstein, mistaking him for Rick. They have to tell him that he should not be messing with time, but this leads Einstein to spite them by devising the famous massâ€“energy equivalence equation, E=mc2.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 2: \"Mortynight Run\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDavid Phillips\\tAugust 2, 2015\\tRAM-202\\t2.19[12]\\nRick takes Morty on a trip to teach him how to pilot the flying car. When Rick realizes that Jerry has followed them without being noticed in the back seat, he leaves him in a daycare specifically designed for Jerries from alternate realities. Jerry socializes with other Jerries, some of them left there indefinitely because their Rick and Morty never returned. Rick sells an antimatter gun to Krombopulos Michael, an alien assassin who intends to use it to eliminate a gaseous being whom Rick nicknames Fart that is held captive by alien authorities. Rick plans to spend the day at the \"Blips & Chitz\" video arcade, but Morty decides to stop the assassin. After Rick and Morty release Fart, they are chased by the authorities. Fart uses telepathic powers to kill the authorities, which also leads to civilian casualties. Later, Morty learns that Fart wants to eliminate all carbon-based life forms. Morty then kills Fart using Krombopulous Michael\\'s antimatter gun. Rick and Morty return to pick up their Jerry, but it is left unclear whether they got the right one.[a]\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A promotional ad for \"Blips & Chitz\" with Rick making an appearance.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 3: \"Auto Erotic Assimilation\"\\tBryan Newton\\tRyan Ridley\\tAugust 9, 2015\\tRAM-203\\t1.94[13]\\nRick attempts to loot a damaged spaceship with Morty and Summer. They find Unity, a hive mind and Rick\\'s ex-lover. It plans to eventually assimilate the whole universe. Beta 7 is a male hive mind who has a crush on Unity, which it rejects. In a planet completely assimilated by Unity, it and Rick have parties, have sex, and drink and use drugs together. In light of all the revelry, it loses control and the planet is left messy and untended. Summer finds the assimilation unethical, until she and Morty witness some inhabitants regain their identities and start a race war. Eventually, Unity decides to leave Rick for its own good. Meanwhile, Beth and Jerry find a secret underground room with a slug-like monster. The couple has an argument where Jerry makes accusations against Rick and Beth tries to defend her father. The monster breaks free of its chains and accuses Beth and Jerry of having the worst relationship it has ever seen. An upset Beth confronts a visibly distressed Rick, who attempts suicide in the garage but fails.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: A drunken Rick attempts to contact Unity only to be blocked by Beta 7.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 4: \"Total Rickall\"\\tJuan Meza-LeÃ³n\\tMike McMahan\\tAugust 16, 2015\\tRAM-204\\t1.96[14]\\nAlien parasites plant fake memories in the minds of the Smith family and pretend they are friends and family members. Every time the family reminisces about the past, the aliens reproduce. The family can\\'t distinguish real people from aliens, so eventually they can\\'t even trust each other. To prevent further spread, Rick locks down the house. At first, the only alien present is the fake \"Uncle Steve\"; they are soon joined by other aliens including Cousin Nicky, Sleepy Gary (who poses as Beth\\'s husband and Jerry\\'s lover), the family butler Mr. Beauregard, Frankenstein\\'s Monster, a talking pencil named Pencilvester, Tinkles the Fairy Lamb, etc. Mr. Poopybutthole is an unusual yellow creature who did not appear in any previous episode but appears to be a longtime friend. Eventually, Morty discovers that the parasites can only create positive memories, allowing the Smith family to confirm one another\\'s existence and kill all the aliens. As they sit down to dinner, Beth shoots Mr. Poopybutthole, thinking he is a parasite as well, but he turns out to be real.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Mr. Poopybutthole goes through physical therapy. Beth is devastated.\\n\\nNote: An alternate version of this episode, titled \"Rick and Morty Babies,\" premiered on Adult Swim as part of its 2021 April Fools\\' Day prank. This version featured all of the characters dubbed over to sound like children and changed some of the profanity to more \"kid-friendly\" alternatives.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 5: \"Get Schwifty\"\\tWes Archer\\tTom Kauffman\\tAugust 23, 2015\\tRAM-205\\t2.12[15]\\nA massive alien head (a \"Cromulon\") appears over Earth, demanding to hear an original song, so Rick and Morty improvise \"Get Schwifty\". The whole planet is abducted and forced to participate in a musical talent show, where the losers\\' planets are obliterated via plasma ray. Morty steals Rick\\'s portal gun and leaves him alone with Ice-Tâ€”the only musician to survive an earthquake that struck the Grammy Awardsâ€”to make a hit original song and save earth. Morty stumbles across Birdperson (living with Tammy since \"Ricksy Business\"), who persuades him to go back to Rick. Ice-T is revealed to be an ice alien who does not initially care about Earth, but he later changes his mind and saves the planet. Rick, Morty, and the US president win the competition by improvising \"Head Bent Over\". Meanwhile, Jerry, Beth, and Summer enter a religious cult based on an incorrect interpretation of the message from Cromulons. The movement quickly disbands after realizing it was all a musical talent show.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Back at Alphabetrium, Ice-T\\'s home planet, his father rewards Ice-T by lifting his exile and restoring his true form, \"Water-T\". The Numbericons attack and Water-T rushes out to battle. This is an action movie promo.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 6: \"The Ricks Must Be Crazy\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Guterman\\tAugust 30, 2015\\tRAM-206\\t1.91[16]\\nRick\\'s flying car will not start, so he and Morty investigate the problem. The car\\'s battery contains a miniature universe and Rick has been threatening their destruction if they do not generate electricity. Inside it, Zeep Xanflorp, that universe\\'s top scientist, created a second miniature universe for the same purpose. Rick, Morty and Zeep are left stranded in a third miniature universe, as the pilot commits suicide and destroys his ship. Rick and Zeep constantly fight, and Morty abandons them and becomes a native chief. Morty forces the two scientists to work together to escape. While escaping, Rick reveals that Morty can turn into a car if needed. Ultimately, Rick and Morty leave the battery, trapping Zeep. Zeep is forced to discontinue his miniature universe research and have his people resume generating electricity to prevent Rick from destroying their universe. Meanwhile, Summer is forced to stay in the flying car, which uses violence to \"keep Summer safe\" from strangers, while she protests. However, it is effectively pardoned once it prepares a peace treaty, ending the human-spider war that has existed in this alternate reality. As a result, ice cream is now served with flies to appeal to spiders.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Morty suddenly turns into a car in his class.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 7: \"Big Trouble in Little Sanchez\"\\tBryan Newton\\tAlex Rubens\\tSeptember 13, 2015\\tRAM-207\\t1.97[17]\\nRick becomes \"Tiny Rick\" by transferring his mind to a teenage clone of himself in order to kill a vampire in Morty and Summer\\'s school. Tiny Rick is outgoing and popular, but subconsciously cries for help in song lyrics and drawings. Much to the disdain of her classmates, Summer deliberately gets him expelled by denouncing him as the killer of the vampire Coach Feratu (a reference to Nosferatu). Morty and Summer eventually persuade Rick to return to his body. Meanwhile, Jerry and Beth experience couple therapy on an alien planet. Two manifestations of the partners\\' perceptions of one another are created: Jerry\\'s Beth is embodied as a towering, hostile Xenomorph-like insectoid, and Beth\\'s Jerry is a servile worm. The insectoid Beth goes on a rampage with the help of the worm Jerry, killing several couples and employees. Eventually, Jerry acts in a brave way, causing Beth to envision a strong Jerry, which in turn envisions a goddess-like Beth, who destroys the insectoid monster.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: The lead vampire complains about the use of names like \"Coach Feratu\" that give away their vampire status.\\nSeason 2, Episode 8: \"Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate\"\\tJuan Meza-LeÃ³n\\tDan Guterman, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 20, 2015\\tRAM-208\\t1.79[18]\\nJerry is treated in an alien hospital after unknowingly ingesting some bacteria stored by Rick in a pint of Cherry Garcia. While his family is in the waiting room, watching an assortment of TV channels from alternate realities, Jerry is asked by doctors to donate his penis, to be converted into a replacement heart to save the life of civil rights activist Shrimply Pibbles. Jerry complies, but publicly tries to talk his way out of it nonetheless. This causes Jerry to be hated by the public, but also raises awareness as well as money to buy a synthetic heart for Pibbles. Eventually, Jerry changes his mind and holds the doctors hostage, demanding that they go through with the transplant procedure, but Security stops him. The family is then sent home, with Beth chastising Jerry that he should not care so much about what strangers think of him.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Jerry tries to eat Rick\\'s \"Eyeholes\", an alien cereal that appeared in the interdimensional TV, only for the Eyehole Man to burst through the window and begin relentlessly beating him.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 9: \"Look Who\\'s Purging Now\"\\tDominic Polcino\\tDan Harmon, Ryan Ridley & Justin Roiland\\tSeptember 27, 2015\\tRAM-210\\t1.89[19]\\nRick and Morty visit another planet to purchase wiper fluid and witness \"The Festival\", an annual event where the local populace commits crimes for one night without consequence. After initial hesitation, Morty forces Rick to rescue Arthricia, a young alien girl, who proceeds to betray them, stealing Rick\\'s gun and spaceship. Rick calls Summer, who transports them advanced armor suits. Morty then goes on a seemingly uncharacteristic killing spree before Rick knocks him out, and he and Arthriciaâ€”who desired to stop the Festivalâ€”storm the castle of the corrupt nobility who introduced it, slaughtering them. The planet\\'s remaining inhabitants decide to create a new society; however, rioting breaks out over disputes, and one suggests keeping the Festival after all. Morty feels guilt over his rampage, but Rick (falsely) blames it on the effects of a candy bar he ate, and asserts that his character remains unchanged.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Beth discovers that Jerry wasted $700 calling Taddy Mason, who charges money just to talk on the phone, telling him to get a job.\\n\\nSeason 2, Episode 10: \"The Wedding Squanchers\"\\tWes Archer\\tTom Kauffman\\tOctober 4, 2015\\tRAM-209\\t1.84[20]\\nRick and his family attend the wedding of Birdperson and Tammy, whose guest list includes seventeen of the Federation\\'s most wanted â€” including Rick and Birdperson. At the wedding reception, Tammy reveals herself to be a Federation agent and kills Birdperson. Numerous agents invade the building, starting a battle against the guests. Rick gets his family out of the wedding safely, but they are unable to return home as the Federation would be looking for them there, so Rick takes them to a terraformed asteroid. Rick overhears Jerry proposing to turn Rick in and return to Earth, so Rick allows himself to be arrested. His family returns to Earth, which has joined the Federation and is crowded by alien tourists. Jerry is assigned a job by the Federation.\\n\\nPost-credits scene: Mr. Poopybutthole asks the audience what they think will happen in season 3, and harasses a pizza delivery man with the same question. He also states that season 3 will come in a year and a half.\\n\\n\\nQuestion: Who is the best character?\\nAnswer:'}"
